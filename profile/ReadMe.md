# Welcome
The repositories within this organization are organized based on the main tasks of CYGNO analysis WP. Each repository has a readme explaining the general purpose of the task and people on it.

Each repository also contains the code used by people involved in the task to perform the analysis. General code for featured plug and play (reconstruction, digitization, general classes for post-reco analysis, daq) is in [Cygnus-RD](https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD). Code saved here is expected to be minimal required to fulfil the specific analysis.

If jupyter notebooks are used by the users, here only the code without the output should be pushed to the repositories.

## Project
In the [Analysis scheme project](https://github.com/orgs/CYGNO-Analysis/projects/1/views/1) you can find a general status of the analysis with the subtasks of each task separated with the completed, ongoing and future ones.
